# About this repository
This is an 8-bit sound waveform generator/synthesizer that I long wish to build.
I expect this audio plugin should be simple yet powerful to generate 8-bit sound (like Famicom but no just Famicom).

This is my first time writing an audio plugin,
so obviously this is my first project related to audio stuff.
I'm still learning how to make audio plugins from this tutorial:

[Making Audio Plugins by Martin Finke](http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html)

The whole project is base on the WDL-OL library which you can find it here:

I also used these free tools to help me finishing this work:

* JKnobMan - creating knobs and sliders etc.: [http://www.g200kg.com/en/software/knobman.html](http://www.g200kg.com/en/software/knobman.html)
* SAVIHost - testing VST version plugins: [http://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm](http://www.hermannseib.com/english/savihost.htm)
